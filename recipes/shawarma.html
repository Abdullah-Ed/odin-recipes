  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Shawarma is a Levantine Arab meat preparation, where meat is placed on a spit and may be grilled for as long as a day. Shawarma can be served with various toppings and vegetables such as tahini, hummus, amba, or pickled cucumbers. It is mostly wrapped in pita bread. As most of us don't have a rotating spit at homes, this recipe is cooked on the stovetop. After all, in this fast life who is gonna wait for a whole day?</p>

  <h2>Chef's Notes:</h2>
  <p>For best results, measure by weight, not volume for this. You should measure out 325 grams water and 18 ounces flour by weight (500 grams).</p>
